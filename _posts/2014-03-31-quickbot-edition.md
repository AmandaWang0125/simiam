We just released the newest version of Sim.I.am. This version is the fourth release and is dubbed the "QuickBot Edition." This release merges all changes made to the simulator from the Coursera MOOC, [Control of Mobile Robots](https://www.coursera.org/course/conrob). The most exciting addition is the low-cost mobile robot platform, the QuickBot, including a button to connect the simulator with the real hardware! This feature has also been implemented for the Khepera III.

If you are interested in building the QuickBot for use with the simulator, check out [O'Botics](http://o-botics.org). The newest release of Sim.I.am is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jdelacroix/simiam/releases/tag/simiam-the-fourth) and the [MATLAB File Exchange](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/40860-sim-i-am).
